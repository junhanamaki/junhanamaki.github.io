          <h1>About me:</h1>
          <p>
            Hello, and thanks for your visit! I am a software developer with passion for music,
            gaming, traveling and technology in general :)
          </p>
          <p>
            Professionaly I started working at <a href="http://www.tecmic.pt/en/">TECMIC SA</a>, where I
            had the chance to work on the development of a bus fleet management system (XTraN Passenger),
            and a decision support system for prevention and management of disasters (4Forces).
            I was involved, for both of them, in the implementation of both the server and desktop client
            applications, using technologies like <b>.NET framework with C#, NHibernate, Transact SQL, C++, Java,
            Visual Basic 6, Google Earth API and ArcGIS API</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 5 years at TECMIC, now I work at <a href="http://www.linkedcare.com/">linkedcare</a>,
            where I'm involved in the development of a web application which assists the physicians on their daily work,
            and also on a web application for patients to help, among other things, manage their clinical history.
            Here I worked both in the front-end and back-end. I worked with <b>Ruby and its several web
            application frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, Padrino and also an in-house custom framework for our web
            application and micro services.
            Besides that I also worked with other server side technologies like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, Sidekiq
            and ElasticSearch. Also had the chance to experiment with nginx a bit, namely use lua to make it act as an API Gateway.
            Working on client side involved working with HTML, CSS and it goes without saying, JavaScript.
            Among the libraries/frameworks that I used where React, jQuery, Angular, Handlebars and Bootstrap.
            Our workflow is powered by, among others technologies, by GitHub, Shippable, Pivotal and Travis.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            At the moment I feel most confortable working with JavaScript and Ruby, feeling great with React and Rails.
            Hoping to learn Go and/or Elixir some time in the near future!
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for your attention,
          </p>
          <p>
